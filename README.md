The playground app I created for WWDC 2022 is called Bug Blast. I created this game to explore the technologies of virtual reality and its possibilities on mobile devices. Bug Blast is a virtual reality space shooter game where anyone with an iPad can experience zooming through space and saving Planet Apple from terrifying space bugs.

The app features an intro screen to prompt the user that Planet Apple is under attack by space bugs who are creeping toward the planet, which leads into a high stakes virtual reality game of maneuvering through space to shoot the space bugs with repair bullets, and also features an immersive experience with audio.

I implemented all the features described above using:
RealityKit + ARKit
To place and operate the virtual reality space game
SwiftUI:
To layout and present the user interface of the spaceship and other information.
Wrapped the RealityKit screen in a UIViewRepresentable
AVFoundation
To play the background music and sound effects.
GarageBand
To create the catchy background music and space sound effects.
Blender
To create all the 3D objects such as Planet Apple, space bugs, explosions, and the repair bullets.
